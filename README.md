# WeatherApp

For this app, I had to be able to look up the weather in any city you enter into the input field

In order to do this I had to pull the input from the said field, then generate a button with that city's name that would store on top of the next cities to be entered

From there, I used the weather API to pull the current weather from that city as well as the forecast for the next 5 days along with icons displaying the conditions

From that point I had to make sure that the last city searched was saved to the local storage and get that information next time the page is loaded.
